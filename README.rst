This code implements Monte-Carlo exploration of districting plans, exploring the
space around an initial districting plan to give some idea of the degree of
gerrymandering. It is a Python rewrite of the `chain" C++ program<https://github.com/gerrymandr/cfp_mcmc>`_, originally by
Maria Chikina, Alan Frieze and Wesley Pegden, for their paper, "Assessing
significance in a Markov chain without mixing."
